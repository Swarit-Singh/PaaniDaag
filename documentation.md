# Reversible Watermarking Project Documentation

## Overview
This project implements reversible watermarking using two methods: Prediction Error Expansion and Histogram Shifting. It supports embedding and extraction with options for both methods.

## Features
- Dual watermarking methods with selection
- Automated quality and robustness testing
- User-friendly Streamlit web app
- Visualization utilities for histograms and image comparison

## Usage
- Use the Streamlit app (`app.py`) for interactive watermarking.
- Run `watermark_quality_test.py` for automated quality and robustness tests.

## Visualization
- Visualize original, watermarked, and recovered images.
- Plot histograms before and after embedding.

## Comparison
- Compare PSNR, SSIM, and extraction accuracy between methods.

## Future Work
- Implement more advanced adaptive embedding.
- Improve blind extraction accuracy.
- Integrate more state-of-the-art algorithms.
